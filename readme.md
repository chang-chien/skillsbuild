IBM SkillsBuild Platform Innovation - Strategy Game Learning Experience

## Description
This project is in collaboration with IBM, as part of my master's thesis for Management of Information Systems and Digital Innovation Programme at Warwick Business School

The goal of this project is to design and develop a browser-based strategy game inspired by Tribal Wars. The purpose of the game is to promote IBM's SkillsBuild learning platform among university students by integrating technical-related educational skills, especially AI, directly into the gameplay.
